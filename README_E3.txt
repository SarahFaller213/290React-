which features youâ€™ve implemented
We have implemnted writing to a database, reading from a database, delete data from a database, and sort of update the database!
We can write to the database on the dashboard page and the profile page! We can delete from the databse on the dashboard as well. We can do this by deleting one of your ideas. We also read from the database on this page because it shows your old ideas that you have already posted. In the profile page you can also add to the database by adding your school, degree, and skills. 

In addition, signing up adds to the database as well!

I had some trouble reading from the database but luckily my partner had prior experience with firebase and react so she was able to help me out. 

it took us about 6 hours to complete this excerse.
